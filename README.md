# Torque Thingy
_Created in 2022_

Torque Thingy is a tool designed for calculating torques and ensuring they adhere to balance and stability restrictions, such as the 20% Rule. Created for a 9th-grade Physics and Engineering class, this project simulates the calculations necessary for designing balanced mobiles or other systems involving torque and leverage.

## How It Works
- **Inputs:** Users enter values for the masses of two objects, the length of the tier (beam), the mass of the tier itself, and the distance from the ends of the tier.
- **Calculations:** The tool calculates the torque on both sides of the tier and solves for the equilibrium point. It verifies whether the setup meets the specified balance constraints, such as the 20% Rule, which limits how off-center the weight distribution can be.
- **Output:** The program displays the equation used to balance the torques and provides the solution, highlighting if the setup passes or fails the specified rule.

## Features
- **Interactive Input Interface:** Users can input various parameters, such as the masses of two objects, the tier length, and the distance from the ends, to set up their torque calculation scenario.
- **Automatic Torque Calculation:** The tool automatically calculates and compares the torques on both sides of the tier to determine the equilibrium point.
- **Equation Breakdown:** Clearly displays the torque equation used and the step-by-step process to solve for balance, enhancing understanding of the physics behind the calculation.
- **20% Rule Verification:** Checks whether the setup complies with the 20% Rule, ensuring the weight distribution is within an acceptable range for stability.
- **Pass/Fail Indicator:** Provides immediate feedback on whether the entered configuration is balanced and adheres to the rule restrictions.
- **User-Friendly Output:** Neatly resents all results and calculations in a simple, easy-to-understand format.
